## Project 1: Using A* Algorithm to Climb Mountains

Given a topographical map of Mount St. Helens, this algorithm finds the most optimal path to the summit. The A* algorithm provides a more optimal solution than Dijkstra's algorithm by taking account heuristics for certain cost paths. This Reduces the cost of searching for irrelevant nodes while finding the shortest path, and is faster/computationally more efficient that Dijkstra's algorithm.
